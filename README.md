# active-background-animator

> **PLEASE NOTE:** This project is still in early stage. A huge amount of development is still required. The structure will change making some animations obsolete.

### Make your content more atractive

This is a JavaScript library using jQuery to add background animations to HTML elements.  
The purpose is to make the design dynamic more than bringing actual functionalities to the website.

## Download

Get the [development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/repraze/active-background-animator/master/lib/jquery.active-background-animator.js) version.

## Getting Started

active-background-animator.js is easy to use, simply run:

``` js
$('header').activeBackgroundAnimator();
```

In the future you will be passing an array of animations and options.
